# Word Scramble Game

A simple and interactive Python word scramble game. The player is shown a scrambled word and must guess the correct original word within 3 attempts. Each correct answer earns points, and the game continues until the player chooses to stop.

---

## Project Files

- `pythonprojects.py` → main Python script  
- `words.txt` → word list used by the game  
- `.gitignore` → ignores unnecessary files like virtual environments and compiled Python files  

---

## How to Play

1. Run `pythonprojects.py`
2. The game will show a scrambled word.
3. You have **3 attempts** to guess the correct word.
4. Each correct guess earns **5 points**.
5. After each word, you can choose to continue or quit.

## How to Run the Game

1. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash

## Requirements

## Ideas for Future Improvements

- [Add difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard)](#)  
- [Add a timer for each attempt](#)  
- [Track high scores across sessions](#)  
- [Add hints after failed attempts](#)  
- [Convert to GUI version using Tkinter or PyQt](#)
